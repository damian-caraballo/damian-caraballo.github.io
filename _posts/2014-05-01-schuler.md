description: Sch&uuml;ler is a complete student grading platform service for charter and private schools that want to use an alternative to district provided grading software.

<p>Grading software provided by school districts can often be cumbersome and frustrating to use for charter/private schools that don't necessarily follow the same schedule or guidelines of their public school neighbors.</p>
<p>Sch&uuml;ler features a drag-and-drop assignment calendar, flexible grading parameters, school-wide student information database, parent login, and more.</p>
