<p>This project was particularly challenging and fun because of the need to utilize external resources to create a comprehensive and custom e-commerece system. Companies such as Stripe (for payment processing), Twilio (for phone reordering), and EasyPost (for shipping labels) provide REST services that make the customer's experience more engaging and the company's order processing incredibly painless.</p>
